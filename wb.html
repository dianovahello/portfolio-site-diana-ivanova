                  <span class="bold-span">Wild Bloom </span> is a contemporary
                  tea company helping discerning urbanites obtain ethically
                  sourced, wild-picked teas. The aim of this project was
                  twofold: develop a cohesive and unique brand that effectively
                  communicates the company values of Wild Bloom, and apply it in
                  the design of a user-centric UI for their e-commerce platform.

                  <span class="bold-span"> The first challenge </span> lay in
                  capturing both luxury and ethical consciousness through a
                  branding process. The second was to create a shopping platform
                  that communicates the brand and can house large amounts of
                  information without sacrificing usability.

                <p>
                  <span class="bold-span"> The outcome </span> is a
                  comprehensive brand guide and e-commerce UI that blend a
                  tongue-in-cheek Victorian esthetic with the contemporary
                  principles of accessible design and usability.

                <p>
                  The brand development process began with research. I dove into
                  company materials and the web to fully understand their ethos,
                  unique offering, client base and competitors. I used research
                  insights to refine a brand concept and strategy that
                  positioned Wild Bloom as a provider of “simplicity, luxury,
                  and positive impact.” With this in mind, I crafted a visual
                  identity inspired by the Victorian era and the famous wit of
                  Oscar Wilde. The outcome of this process was the documentation
                  of the brand into a detailed Brand Guide. Read on to discover
                  the details of the branding journey, or
                  <a href="#wb-ui-process-overview">Skip to Phase Two</a> of
                  this project, in which I designed an e-commerce platform for
                  Wild Bloom.

                <h3>Company profile</h3>
                <p>
                  Who are Wild Bloom? They are a modern tea company operating at
                  the intersection of luxury, ethics, and innovation. Champions
                  of a wild-picked product, their signature line of “nude tea”
                  is sourced in micro-quantities around the world and packaged
                  with zero processing or additives. Each flavor is handled
                  separately, while blend-lovers can follow unique recipes.
                </p>
                <h3>Target audience</h3>
                <p>
                  Wild Bloom caters to a demographic of sophisticated

                <h3>Core principles</h3>
                <p>
                  After understanding Wild Bloom&#39;s unique value proposition,
                  I defined three core principles that express it vividly and
                  can be used to guide my design decisions: Wildness, Luxury,
                  and Ethics.
                </p>
                <ol class="numberless">
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold-span">1. A call to wildness</span>
                    <p>
                      WB has a mission to “rewild” our tea habit by championing
                      wild-picked tea, and tea grown via “rewilding” (rather
                      than simply sustainable) practices. Their commitment to
                      “wildness” is also an invitation to live the excitement of
                      foreign lands and exotic flavors.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold-span">2. Luxury</span>
                    <p>
                      WB offers a luxury product. Teas are foraged by hand in
                      the wild all over the world with careful attention to each
                      plant, then dried and packaged one flavor at a time, to
                      ensure the most pure and natural experience.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold-span">3. Ethics</span>
                    <p>
                      Long after the colonial era, the tea industry continues to
                      be associated with unfair labor practices, harmful
                      agricultural methods, and a long supply chain. Instead,
                      Wild Bloom partners with local communities of foragers and
                      growers to support small scale, old-growth arbor tea
                      production and fully wild foraging methods. This benefits
                      both the natural and human local ecosystems.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                <h3>Brand direction</h3>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold-span">First key challenge:</span>
                  How can I express this rich set of values? After visual
                  research into the history of tea, I chose to evoke the
                  luxurious style of the Victorian era. A modern treatment of
                  typography and white space would ensure the brand feels
                  contemporary, and digital products have high usability. To
                  express the Ethics principle, I would maintain transparency by
                  folding informative content into the digital interface. Last
                  came the principle of Wildness. I would channel the famous wit
                  and style of Oscar Wilde. A touch of playful humor in the copy
                  would help the brand come to life.

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>
                  The first specific branding element I defined was typography.
                  This choice defines which style of imagery, textures, and
                  layouts will work well later on, so it is an important and
                  early step that everything else is based on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I chose Libre Baskerville for headings over 24pt. It&#39;s a
                  legible serif optimized for digital use. It connects the
                  product to Victorian esthetic and imparts a sense of luxury.
                  Smaller headings and body text are set in Lato: a humanist
                  sans serif that has warmth but reflects the brand&#39;s
                  commitment to sleek, modern usability.

                  />
                </a>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold-span">Note:</span> My first plan was to use
                  Playfair Display for larger headings, and Nanum Gothic for
                  smaller text. They paired beautifully and lent an air of
                  luxury to the material. However, when I built the first mobile
                  screens in Phase two of the project, I felt that the elegance
                  of Playfair and warmth of Nanum Gothic weren't coming through
                  as intended, and legibility was suffering. I made the change,
                  then came back to update the brand guide.

                <h3>Voice</h3>
                <p>
                  In true Oscar Wilde fashion, Wild Bloom&#39;s brand voice must
                  have intelligence, wit, sophistication. The product line
                  titled “Nude Teas” allows for playful copy &#8208; within
                  decorum of course!
                </p>

                  />
                </a>
                <h3>Logo</h3>
                <p>
                  In the logo I sought a balance between a historical,
                  handcrafted pictorial language and modern usability
                  requirements. While the logo is an illustration in the
                  Victorian Naturalist style, it contains brand elements such as
                  the initials WB, the principle of going wild as a dancing
                  flower, and a small reference to the rod of Asclepius, hinting
                  at the medicinal benefits of a pure lifestyle. I created a
                  reduced silhouette to be used in place of the detailed
                  illustration at sizes below 1.5 in., ensuring clarity across
                  applications.

                <!-- <h3>Iconography</h3>
                <p>
                  I used Material icons throughout the project. They have a
                  friendly, sleek and legible style, and are crafted to a high
                  standard of usability and consistency.

                  />
                </a> -->
                <h3>Color Palette</h3>
                <p>
                  I built a complementary palette of rich hues that evoke
                  Victorian grandeur and adventurous tea voyages. Backgrounds,
                  surfaces, and text blocks take on analogous warm tones, while
                  interactive elements use a contrasting dark blue.

                  />
                </a>
                <h3>Image Guidelines</h3>
                <p>
                  I defined image guidelines for illustrations, photography, and
                  humans.These guidelines should cover every image use within
                  the company brand, beyond the app that I would design next.
                  Image guidelines help keep the focus on the brand principles
                  by emphasizing clarity, realism, and respect.
                </p>

                </a>
                <h3>Validation and next steps</h3>
                <p>
                  A clear and consistent visual identity can be evaluated by how
                  well it resonates with the target audience, and how
                  effectively it communicates the company&#39;s values. The
                  well-crafted and consistently applied brand ultimately leads
                  to increased engagement, higher conversion rates, and stronger
                  customer loyalty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To assess interest and engagement levels, I consulted members
                  of the target audience and met with positive responses. A
                  comprehensive testing phase is preferred, however, so in
                  future the brand identity can be validated and iterated on
                  with the help of A/B testing or a Brand Perception Survey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I documented the visual guidelines in a living Brand
                  Guidelines document that will serve as a reference and ensure
                  consistent brand representation across various touchpoints
                  over time.

                  With the Brand Guide in place, I turned my attention to
                  designing Wild Bloom&#39;s online store. Curious about Phase

                <p>
                  I revisited my user personas with a focus on where, when, and
                  why they would use Wild Bloom&#39;s online store. I also
                  researched existing solutions for purchasing wild-picked tea
                  online. This helped me understand the needs and pain points
                  that I need to address. I discovered that
                </p>
                <h4>"for urban dwellers, wild tea is hard to get."</h4>
                <p>
                  Currently very few, specialized, and difficult-to-access
                  vendors can offer a product that is fully wild. Clients have
                  to do their own research, and navigate the complex language of
                  fair-trade and organic certifications around the world. They
                  need to travel to specialty fairs, out-of-the-way brick and
                  mortar stores, or trust small online vendors whose digital
                  stores are hastily built with little care for UX or branding.
                  Even then, clients will encounter very limited flavor options.

                  The project brief dictated some specific user stories that I
                  needed to address. From these, combined with research
                  insights, I extracted key features like guest browsing, a
                  well-organized cart, and a secure checkout process. Building
                  upon this foundation, I sketched out flows and key wireframes
                  for the platform.

                <p>
                  After refining the wireframes, I applied the visual brand. I
                  did this carefully and with my
                  <span class="bold-span">second key challenge</span> in mind: I
                  had to maintain high usability at small screen sizes and still
                  communicate the Victorian-inspired visual identity. Three
                  things helped: consistent use of a limited color palette,
                  keeping heavier touches to empty pages like the confirmation
                  page shown below, and maintaining clear and consistent
                  typographic hierarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I changed typefaces at this stage: I had intended to use
                  Playfair Display for headings until I started building mobile
                  screens. I opted for Baskerville Libre instead: it has great
                  legibility and balanced letter forms well suited for digital
                  applications.

                  I prepared mockups of the Home page, Product page, and
                  Checkout flow. I built a high-fidelity prototype to give a
                  fuller sense of the shopping experience. I also created a
                  Desktop version of the UI to define its responsive behavior.

                    <p>
                      A Victorian-inspired esthetic presents a usability
                      challenge because of the period&#39;s rich use of detail
                      and bold typography. I strategically integrated
                      Victorian-inspired touches into the UI while prioritizing
                      readability and navigation.
                    </p>

                    >
                    <p>
                      The challenge lay in crafting a brand voice that captured
                      the right blend of humor and sophistication. To meet this
                      challenge I channeled the wit and style of Oscar Wilde,
                      using taglines like "We make tea nude" and playful
                      hashtags to convey the brand&#39;s personality within the
                      bounds of decorum.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold-span"
                      >3. Presenting lots of information within a clean and
                      appealing UI</span
                    >
                    <p>
                      To maintain transparency and protect user trust, I needed
                      to house detailed information about the company&#39;s
                      products, sourcing, and local initiatives within a clean
                      and appealing interface. I did this by organizing content
                      hierarchically, using expandable sections for additional
                      information, and integrating intuitive navigational
                      elements to ensure that users had access without
                      overwhelm.

                      1. I would like to conduct further testing to validate the
                      brand strategy and ensure the second iteration of the UI
                      meets user expectations and needs.

                    <p>
                      2. It would be useful to collaborate with a dedicated
                      content strategist to ensure that the textual content
                      aligns seamlessly with the visual brand identity and user
                      experience. This would enhance the platform&#39;s message
                      clarity and establish a compelling narrative throughout
                      the user journey.

                      3. Thirdly, I would create a comprehensive design system
                      to centralize visual and UI components, fostering
                      consistency and efficiency across design and development
                      efforts, and ensuring the project is scalable.
